# Space Invaders Clone
My very first project made entirely on my own in March 2020.
Of course I learned a lot since then, but I feeled like sharing it so here it is!


# Introduction

Before you do anything, you should know there are 2 main "parts" in this project:

1) The builds for the end user: Windows, Linux, Mac. We will call it the USER VERSION.

2) The source code running in the engine available to you. We will call it the DEVELOPPER VERSION.




# Instructions for the USER VERSION

Make sure you read the Introduction chapter before you start.

1) Go into the EXPORT folder.

2) Go to the folder with the name of your operating system (example: You are on Linux, go in the folder 'Multiplayer-P2P-Join-at-Runtime-LINUX')

3) Extract the file wherever you want SO LONG AS the .pck and the executable file are together, otherwise it won't work!

4) Run the executable file




# Instructions for the DEVELOPPER VERSION

Make sure you read the Introduction chapter before you start.

1) Download Godot 3.2.2 here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases

You can choose a more recent version but it will be different from the one that was used to build this project, which could lead to incompatibility issues. If you want the last version of Godot anyway, download it here: https://godotengine.org/download

2) In the folder of the project, right click on the file 'project.godot' and execute it with Godot.

3) Press F5 to run the game.



# Known issues

At that time I didn't know how to handle inputs to select the buttons in the menu.
You should just use the mouse to navigate the menus.

The fact players are colliding is not an issue. It was intended.

Change Key Bindings is not working because it was simply not implemented.
Again, I didn't know how to do that at that time.
